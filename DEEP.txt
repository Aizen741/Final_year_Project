deep learning neural network

CNN

it enable to clasify and analyse data
it is not one process it is a complex network interconnected in layers

each layer cnn can identify abstract or higher features

when CNN identify such feature it apply the filter

it can be seen as local structures
 .. it can be textures ,curves ,edges etc
what the filters are doing are constituting little miniature version

each of these building blocks



the way the CNN looks for these building blocks is the ' C' 
which stands for convolution

so how this works?
so imagine u have one image and then u have stencil and u
pass that stencil over that image till u find a portion of image that
is similar to the stencil

and the process of doing this i mean passing the stencil over the
image is said to be convolution

feature map : how well elements in the image align with the filter
for example a text :
CNN make a feature map for ebery filter and there will be a feature map
for every letter

these feature map will become input  second layer:
the cnn will be spacially aligned and stack all those map 
from previous layer

then the seconf layer will look for the total word example 
adjacent to one another : eg ADA love

the output of the secnd  layer will be the feature map for 
the squence of these three word

In third layer the CNN will stack and align the feature maps from above
and try to find word together eg : "ADA Love"


if we are looking for suppose big paragraph CNN will have more layers



how does it works on xrays :
image is made of pixels

imagine pixels as the drawing made of dots. the more the dots the
more clear the image will be


first layer filter on one pixels:
 texture
 Contrast
 Edges

when CNN go up to the hiegharchy the CNN will be come more complex 
with each layer
